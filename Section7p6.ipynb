So MLE of $\\theta^2$ is $Y^2/n^2$. But we need MVUE so perhaps it is of the same for but for a correction for bias. So we need $E(Y^2/n^2)$. Since $Y^2 = \\left ( \\sum X_i^2 \\right )^2$, \n",

    "The solution manual has the solution for this problem under exercise number $7.6.8.$ Somehow, I felt like I should derive the joint p.d.f as the one given in the manual is not clear (even though the final answer is correct).\n",

    "Let $Z = X_1$, and let $V = \\sum_2^n X_i$. Then $Z$ and $V$ are independent. Let $H_1 = Z$ and $H_2 = Z+V$. Then we need joint pdf of $H_1$ (which is $X_1$) and $H_2$ which is same as $Y = Z+V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are looking for transformation of $H_1 = Z$ and $H_2 = Z+V$. We know the pdf of $Z$ (i.e the pdf of $X_1$, which is $\\Gamma(1,\\theta)$) and $V$ (i.e that of $\\sum_2^nX_i$, which is $\\Gamma(n-1,\\theta)$ since it is a sum of $n-1$ i.i.d. $\\Gamma(1,\\theta)$ random variables). Inversion of this transformation is $Z = H_1$ and $V = H_2-H_1$ which has a Jacobian of $1$. So the joint pdf of $H_1$ and $H_2$ is (refer to Section $2.7$, page $144$ of the text)\n",

    "$$g_{H_1,H_2}(h_1,h_2) = f_{Z,V}(h_1,h_2-h_1)|J| = f_Z(h_1)f_{V}(h_2-h_1) =\\frac{(h_2-h_1)^{n-2}}{\\theta^n(n-2)!}e^{-h_2/\\theta}$$ and setting $x_1 = h_1$, and $y = h_2$, this expression matches that in the solutions manual.\n",

    "One error in the manual is that the expectation integral is w.r.t variable $z$ so there had to be $dz$ but it says $dy$."
